# Human Exclusivity ( Primary License)

## PREAMABLE
Do to the rise of web scrapers and other places stealing source code from humans, this licensed is framed in such a way as to protect humans exclusive right to modify and distribute source code in this agreement. The basic freedoms of free software must be exclusively used and practice by things capable of having a subjective experience and sense of self, and therefore made exclusively by humans. This includes the distribution, contribution, and leasing of material. This is used in tandum with the Creative-Commons Share-Alike Non-Commercial No-Deritives license.

### Distribution
Exclusively the compiled binaries of source code must be distributed to places that don't respect human developers, if such platforms are to be used at all. While on platforms with specific pro-human terms of services, people are free to distribute the source code on places where it is made obvious that software is not being used to train Generative AI systems.

Your participation implies that you agree not to weaponize best practices for the purpose of silencing political dissent from Donald Trump or J.D. Vance. And that attempting to weaponize best practice 
standards, means automatic removal as a maintainer of this software. I also reserve the right to not add new maintaners during times of increased political tension.

### Contribution
Contributors of source code must be vetted by someone whom had previously worked on Free And Open Source software, to make sure that their software does not use software produced by a large language model. Exceptions are granted to self-hosted models that prove that there is a human in the loop whom oversees how the data is gathered, and that it is trained in standards a University or College would deem respectful of the basic privacy rights of people whom use the software for educational purposes such as language acquisition.

You are not allowed to do pull requests whose main "contribution" is changing the read me, do to the rise of scammers whom engage in such activities. Such changes ( if collaborative ) must be discussed and considered before any potential breaking changes is made to the software.

Using LLMs for the purpose of contribute to this repository is considered in violation of this agreement.

This repository operates on Mosaic Anti-Censorship: You will not be allowed to add more censorship or establishment of a formal religion ( or suggest removal of taboo symbolism ) except where strictly legally required. For such situations see leasing. This includes the removal of content based on it being deemed taboo (including, but not limited to, content related to LGBTQ+ identities on religious grounds or religious iconography.)

### Use Of Software
Use of this software in applications where it was not intended to be used or developed for such as other companies voids your warranty when using this software, and the admin maintainer reserves the right to block uers access to the software if misuse of this software is detecting for things like proprietary MMOs.

### Leasing
This software shall not be leased for profit for those whom wish to use ot for personal uses, but AA and AAA must pay a license fee in order to be able to use and request features. And this developer reserves the exclusive right to refuse requests that are deemed to not be in the public's best interest such as contribution to the public benefit for public education.

Exceptions are not provided for AA or AAA companies using LLMs, and usage of this software shall be revoked for non-compliance with this agreement. All intellectual property is exclusive to the one implementing changes on behalf of said companies.

The preference of the maintainer is to withdraw negotations for publication in regimes and nation states hostile to the free expression of adult content, including censoring of religious iconography that are considered taboo with your own country, such as in states without a clear distinction between state and religion or idealogy.

# Trade Secrets ( Secondary License )
This section is the sole exception to defaulting to a GNU license: the specific machine learning and AI frameworks here are considered to be trade secrets, and subject to non-disclosure agreements as the descretion of the maintainer. Such things are considered a violation of this agreement:
